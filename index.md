Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in Bioinformatics at Boston University. Previously, I was an Associate Bioinformatician at Partners Personalized Medicine/Brigham & Women's Hospital (Cambridge,MA). I'm interested in developing statistical methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and in biological data visualization, among other things.
